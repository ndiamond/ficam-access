#Access Control systems#

Physical Access Control Systems (PACs). 
Are sets of connected regulations, practices, personnel & devices designed to admit people and things into places based on identity and purpose of both the place and the party entering or exiting that place. 
The best way to envision how PACs work is to picture an everyday example.  Think of your local grocery store. The doors in front are designed to let anyone in, to attract customers, entry ramps & doors in back are meant for shipments and personnel managing the shipments.  The gates at the counters, offices and stock rooms have locks or codes on them, governed by rules and policies to allow only employees (with keys/codes/ or devices)  handling the given merchandise or service into those areas.  Assessed together, one can observe a Physical Access Control System (PACs)
